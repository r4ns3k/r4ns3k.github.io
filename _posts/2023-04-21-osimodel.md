Osi stands for open system interconnection
by seeing abbreviation we can tell that it is used to fascilitate communication between systems
it is just a model
it has 7 layers
protocols in each layer goverrns the data commuincation
|application Layer|
|--------|
|Presentation Layer|
|Session Layer|
|Transport Layer|
|Network Layer|
|Datalink Layer|
|Physical Layer|

the upper 4 layers are taken care by os,the lower 3 layers taken care by network


lets discuss about each layer for more understanding



|application Layer|all applications on your host which access internet fall in this layer ex:web browser,by using application we can generate raw data given to belowe layers,protocol works on this layer http,smtp...etc|
|--------|---|
|Presentation Layer|do encryption(opt) ,trnsalation,compress(used for multimedia data) the data whatever needed,it will mainly focus on presenting data to the above layer|
|Session Layer|make a session to communicate two devices|
|Transport Layer|Layer 4 is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices,connection control(connection oriented:b4 send data conection created,connetion less data sent as such),port addressing|
|Network Layer|Ip addressing,routing|
|Datalink Layer|data transfer on same network,mac addressing protocols:ethernet,wifi|
|Physical Layer|network hardware fall in this ex:cables,bits |
