OSI stands for Open System Interconnection,by seeing abbreviation we can tell that it is used to fascilitate communication between systems.
it has 7 layers<br>
protocols in each layer goverrns the data commuincation<br>

|1.Application Layer|
|--------|
|2.Presentation Layer|
|3.Session Layer|
|4.Transport Layer|
|5.Network Layer|
|6.Datalink Layer|
|7.Physical Layer|

the upper 4 layers are taken care by os,the lower 3 layers taken care by network<br>
Data from sender computer goes from layer 1-7<br>
data to reciver's computer comes from layer 7-1<br>
each layer interact with its adjascent layers<br>

lets discuss about each layer for more understanding

|application Layer|This is where user interact with applications  which works with internet, ex:web browser,by using application we can generate data given to below layers,protocols works on this layer http,smtp...etc|
|--------|----|
|Presentation Layer|does encryption(optional) ,trnsalation(convert data into common format),compression(used for multimedia data) to data whatever needed,it will mainly focus on presenting data |
|Session Layer|make a session to communicate two devices|
|Transport Layer| responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices,connection control(connection oriented:before send data conection created,connetion less: data sent as such),port addressing(adding src,dest ports),breaks big messages into smaller and combines all smaaler to big message(segmentation & reassembly),protocols:tcp,udp|
|Network Layer|Ip addressing(adding src,dest ip),routing|
|Datalink Layer|responsible for moving data from one node to other,framing,mac addressing(adding src,dest mac) protocols:ethernet,wifi|
|Physical Layer|all data from above layers converted to bits here transmit over a medium,all media fall in this layer|
