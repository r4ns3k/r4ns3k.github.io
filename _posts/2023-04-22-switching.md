if there are many paths in a big network deciding which way to direct the traffic is done by the switching<br>
switching provides a feel like one-to-one connection<br>

divided into 3 categories<br>
1.Circuit switching<br>
2.Message Switching<br>
3.packet switchng subdivided into (i)datgram approach (ii)virtual circuit approach<br>

1.Circuit switching:<br>
before seding data,A dedicated path is stablished between sender and reciever<br>
there are 3 phases in this switching technique<br>
phase-1 connection establishment<br>
phase-2 data transfer<br>
phase-3 connection disconnection<br>

ex:telephone network


2.Message Switching

In this switching message is transferred as complete unit and then forward using store and forward mechanism at intermediary nodes
at intermediary nodes message is broken into pieces

3.Packet switching

this switching technique is used by internet<br>
in packet switching message is broken into individual chunks called packets<br>
each packet will sent individually<br>
each packet will have source ip,destination ip and sequence number

sequence nos will helps to <br>
reorder the packets at destination,deect missing packets,send acks.<br>

i)datagram switching<br>
its also called as connectionless switching<br>
each piece of data is called datagram<br>
datagram contains destination info intermediary devices use this to forwrd the data to right destination<br>

ii)virtual circuit switching

also called as connection oriented switching<br>
in this technique a pre planned route is established before sending data<br>
path is fixed evry packet follow same path
