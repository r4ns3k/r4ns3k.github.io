we know ip address is one of the important element in networking<br>
ip address is used to reach destination computer<br>
when we visit a website say googl.com<br>
the isp is configured us a service called dns<br>
dns will convert domain name into ip address<br>
now ip addresss has 2 parts ,one is network address which is used to reach destination network,host address is used to identify destination host within network,in addition to that destination proceess number (port number) used to reach right process ,for web service server listens on port 80, so our destinatiion port is 80,for well defined ports no need to mention port number.<br>
