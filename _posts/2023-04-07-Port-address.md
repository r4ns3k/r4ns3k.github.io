Port address is used to reach the right process on the host<br>
before we send data host attaches source,destination port numbers<br>
if we want to reach a server it sever uses port 80,i.e our destination port<br>
and we open google chrome to access the server ,google chrome has given a random source port.
finally the data reach the seerver<br>
when server reply it swaps the port numbers<br>
