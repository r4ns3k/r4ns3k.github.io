CIDR stands for classless inter domain routing<br>
there are some disdavntages with calssful addressing cidr will solve those issues<br>
in classfull adressing if we want 100 ip adresses we can go for class c which have 256 hosts,if we want 300 ip's we can go for class b which has more than 300 ips<br>
cidr solve that issue by giving required number of ip addresses in block form<br>
cidr blocks will always contains addresses in the power of 2 like 2^8,2^9...etc<br>
There's no classes in cidr
so how can we find network id ,host id?
cidr notation will tell that,cidr notation will look like this 192.168.1.1/24,here 24 bits used for nid,remaining bits used for host id.
## subnetting in cidr
ex:20.30.40.10/25
we need 2 subnets
lets find host bits
host bits falls on last octet last 7 bits cause nid 25 bits
convert last octet to binary

20.30.40.0 0001010<br>
put all zeros in hid part we will get nid


|20.30.40.0 0000000 to 20.30.40.0(nid)
|20.30.40.0 1111111 to 20.30.40.127(last ip/brd ip)

lets do subneting
|subnet1|subnet2|
|---|---|
|20.30.40.00000000|20.30.40.01000000|
|to|to|
|20.30.40.00111111|20.30.40.011111111

Range of subnet1: 20.30.40.0/26 - 20.30.40.63/26 

Range of subnet2: 20.30.40.64/26 - 20.30.40.127/26

/26 beacuse one more bit used for subnetid
in previous post we have seen all 1's represent subnetid&nid

/26 also represent subnet mask
Subnet Mask-1111111.1111111.1111111.11000000

vlsm in cidr
20.30.40.10/25

|sunet1|subnet2|subnet3|
|---|---|---|
|20.30.40.00000000 |20.30.40.10000000| 20.30.40.11000000|
|to|to|to|
|20.30.40.01111111 |20.30.40.10111111 |20.30.40.11111111|

Range of subnet1: 20.30.40.0 - 20.30.40.127<br>
Range of sunet2: 20.30.40.128 - 20.30.40.192<br>
Range of subnet3: 20.30.40.192 - 20.30.40.255<br>
