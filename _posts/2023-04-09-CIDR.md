CIDR stands for classless inter domain routing<br>
there are some disdavntages with calssful addressing cidr will solve those issues<br>
in classfull adressing if we want 100 ip adresses we can go for class c which have 256 hosts,if we want 300 ip's we can go for class b which has more than 300 ips<br>
cidr solve that issue by giving required number of ip addresses in block form<br>
cidr blocks will always contains addresses in the power of 2 like 2^8,2^9...etc<br>

## cidr notation : a.b.c.d/n
where n tells about which  part is network<br>
ex: 192.168.1.6/24<br>
here first 3 octets i.e 24 bits used for network address,remaining 8 bits used for host address
