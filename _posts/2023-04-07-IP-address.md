lets see ip address of our devices first
## windows users
open command prompt and type ipconfig
you can see IPv4 address and IPv6 in the window
## Linux users 
open terminal and type ip a
based on ur interface u can see ip address if wifi see under wlp6s0 or if ethernet based connection see under enp7s0  u can see ur private ip address beside inet .<br>
ex `inet 192.168.1.2`

That's for practical,now let's go into theory part

As we can see ip address is a just series of numbers seperated by period/dot

==In a [computer network](https://r4ns3k.github.io/What-the-heck-is-computer-networks/) every device is identified with the help of ip address==

Ip address is of 32 bit in length divided into 4 sections each is of 8 bit long seperated by period/dot

Ex: 192.168.1.2

Ip address represented in dotted decimal form

we cant say/remember binary right of 32 bit long, so we can converted it into decimal

## decimal to binary conversion

decimal : 192.168.1.2 <br>
Binary:  11000000.10101000.00000001.00000010<br>

Our computers will use ipaddress to talk to other computer on a computer network network.

there are two types of ip address IPv4 and IPv6 (if IPv4 exhausted we can use for IPv6)


we can assign ip address manually or dynamically.
