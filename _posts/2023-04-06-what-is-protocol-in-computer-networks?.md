If two people wants to talk to each other they must follow some rules which will make  communication  effectuve ,rules include  common language known to both parties,grammer,speed ...etc,likewise two computers can talk to each other by following the rules.
## rules for computer communiation
end device must encode the data to either signals or waves based on media it has connected to,if wired media connected to an end device it will convert data to signals if wireless media connected to an end device it will convert it to waves [message encoding]
both sender and reciver agree on common format for communication [message formatiing]
add source ip address and destination ip addresses along with message so that they know each other and other devices like router knows where to forward data[encapsulation]
break big messages into smaller if the  link cant bear the size[message size]
if sender is sending at highspped and reciever cant handle that speed controll the speed and tell to sender at ehich speed reciever should recieve[flow control]
sender should wait for sometime to get acknowldgement before transmit data[response timeout]
send data to one reciver/multiple recievers/to all [casting]
the above mentioned items are elements of protocols  these are used when we see osi,tcp/ip models
